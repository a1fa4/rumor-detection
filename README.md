This is the source code of the paper 'An End-to-End Rumor Detection Model Based on Feature Aggregation'.  
This work combined the content-based feature and propagation feature to detect rumors by consturcting CNN and RNN model respectively.  
The data set can be downloaded from (http://alt.qcri.org/Ëœwgao/data/rumdect.zip) which is provided in article Detecting rumors from microblogs with recurrent neural networks https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/sis_research/4630/.
